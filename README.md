    My trip to Arkansas starts Friday and I will be driving back on Saturday. I will be driving and hoping I will get back to LA by Monday night. I will continue to write down ideas and work on the database when I can but Devloping does suck using one monitor. My new work station will also be here this summer so I'll dumping most of my free time on this project. New projected demo date will be this Winter and the Full-Release, hopefully Summer 2019.

    Going on a mini vacation starting next week and will probably start on full-production in Mid-June. Will upgrade to a new workstation this summer. I will put in probably about 5-10 hours a week on the game starting then. Winter 2018 will probably end up being Spring/Summer 2019 if I wanna get the game right. I will open up a personal tech blog soon as well.

        Second Revision of the World Map has begun. Close to finishing the layout. I will most likely start on the database for the game this weekend. Will work on a Vue Website for the whole Trilogy.</li></ul>
